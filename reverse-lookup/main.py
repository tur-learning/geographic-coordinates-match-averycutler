# 1) Define the input files
###############################
# HINT: The goal is to analyze the previously non-matched Nolli entries
#       from the previous assignment and try to match them using a different approach.
#
# You will load the **GeoJSON file** generated from the previous assignment.
#
# Define the filename of the GeoJSON file containing previous results.

input_geojson_file = "matched_nolli_features.geojson"

###############################
# 2) Load the GeoJSON data
###############################
# HINT: Use the `load_data()` function to read the JSON content of the file.
#       This will return a dictionary containing all matched & non-matched features.

geojson_data = load_data(input_geojson_file)

###############################
# 3) Split data between matched and non-matched entries

###############################
# HINT: The loaded data is structured as a **FeatureCollection**.
#       It contains both:
#       ‚úÖ Matched Nolli entries (with an associated OSM feature)
#       ‚ùå Non-matched Nolli entries (without an OSM match)
#
# Your goal is to **separate** these two categories.

# Extract the list of features from the GeoJSON data
features = geojson_data["features"]

# Initialize lists to store:
# - `nolli_data`: All Nolli features (both matched and non-matched)
# - `matched_data`: Only matched Nolli entries
# - `matched_ids`: The list of Nolli IDs that have been successfully matched

nolli_data = []
matched_data = []
matched_ids = []

key_to_check = "Matched_Name"

for feature in features:

    properties = feature.get("properties", {})
    nolli_id = properties.get("Nolli_ID")

    # nolli_data.append(feature)

    if key_to_check in properties:
        matched_data.append(feature)
        matched_ids.append(properties.get("Nolli_ID", ""))
    else: 
        nolli_data.append(feature)

# for each feature in features:
#    Extract the properties dictionary
#    Check if some useful key is present in the properties
#    If that key exists:
#       - Append to `matched_data`
#       - Store the `Nolli_ID` in `matched_ids`
#    Otherwise:
#       - Append to `nolli_data`

###############################
# 4) Filter out only the non-matched Nolli entries
# just_matched = {}

# which elements in nolli_data and matched_data
# for el in nolli_data:
    # if el in matched_data:
      #   nolli_id = el.get("properties", {}).get("Nolli_ID", None)  
        
      #   if nolli_id: 
        #    just_matched[nolli_id] = el 
###############################
# HINT: Now, filter `nolli_data` to **retain only** the Nolli features
#       that were **not previously matched**.
#
# Use the `matched_ids` list to check whether each Nolli feature is already matched.

non_matched_data = []

for feature in nolli_data:
    properties = feature.get("properties", {})
    nolli_id = properties.get("Nolli_ID")
    
    if not nolli_id in matched_ids: 
        
 #   if not feature in matched_ids: 
#      unmatched = feature.get("properties", {}).get("Nolli_ID", None)
        non_matched_data.append(feature)

# for each feature in nolli_data:
#    Extract the `Nolli_ID`
#    If `Nolli_ID` is NOT in `matched_ids`, append to `non_matched_data`

# : Use the `if not value in list:` syntax to check if an ID is in a list.

###############################
# 5) Load OSM features from the ZIP file
###############################
# HINT: Since we are performing a **reverse lookup**, we now need to:
# ‚úÖ Extract OSM features from the `geojson_data.zip`
# ‚úÖ Load the OSM dataset
#
# Use:
# - The proper functions to extract and load the OSM data from file

zip_file = "../gottamatch-emall/geojson_data.zip"
geojson_files = ["nolli_points_open.geojson", "osm_node_way_relation.geojson"]



nolli_file, osm = extract_files(zip_file, geojson_files)
# Extract

# Load the OSM features dataset
osm_data = load_data(osm)
osm_features = osm_data.get("features", [])

###############################
# 6) Find the closest OSM match for each non-matched Nolli entry
###############################
# HINT: Instead of fuzzy matching, we now use **geographical proximity**.
#       We will:
#       - Extract **the centroid** of OSM features (using `shapely`).
#       - Measure the **distance** from each non-matched Nolli feature to the nearest OSM feature.
#       - Assign the closest OSM feature to each non-matched Nolli entry.
#
#       Luckily, you don't have to deal with it, because we created the function
#       `find_closest_matches`. Go to utils.py and find out how to use it!
#       Keep the use_geodesic flag to False, otherwise it will take too much time.

matches = find_closest_matches(non_matched_data, osm_features)

###############################
# 7) Save the new matches to JSON
###############################
# HINT: Now that we have found the closest matches for each of 
#       the previously non-matched entries, save the results as 
#       a Standard JSON format for analysis, and as a GeoJSON

# To convert it to GeoJSON format, use the convert_to_geojson(...) function


converted = convert_to_geojson(matches, "matches.geojson")

###############################
# 8) Assignment Submission & Next Steps
###############################
# üéØ **Final Task**: Verify the results!
# - Open your JSON file and check how well the new matches align.
# - Copy/paste your GeoJSON file in https://geojson.io/ and check it.
# - Submit a screenshot of a zoomed view of the GeoJSON together with your code
